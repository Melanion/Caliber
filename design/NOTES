Multiple selects -- one for each attribute of Round
  
  -- possibly "any"/[specific] could change a query strategy (pattern)
  
  -- use queries as strategies:
     
     * Company, Purpose, Caliber XOR Weapon, 
     
     * Company & Purpose, Company & (Caliber XOR Weapon), 
       Purpose & (Caliber XOR Weapon), 

     * Company & Purpose & (Caliber XOR Weapon),

  -- XORs use all those fun joins and stuff, cause you have to go through an
     intermediate table (Caliber in an example where the user selects by purpose)
     
  -- when a select is changed, the UI is updated instantly.
  
  -- adding "cost" attribute to Round would provide us with more strategies
     and particularly more joins:

     * Cost
     
     * Cost & Company, Cost & Purpose, Cost & (Caliber XOR Weapon) 
     
     * Company & Purpose & Cost & (Caliber XOR Weapon)
